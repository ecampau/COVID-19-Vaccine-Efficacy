# Investigating COVID‑19 Vaccine Efficacy Using Agresti‑Coull Confidence Intervals
This repository contains an analysis of COVID‑19 vaccine efficacy using publicly available data from Israel’s government COVID‑19 dashboard (August 15, 2021). The project evaluates how effective the Pfizer‑BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were at preventing severe disease during the surge of the Delta variant.

The analysis uses the Agresti‑Coull confidence interval to estimate severe disease rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations across seven age groups, and then computes both age‑specific and age‑standardized vaccine efficacy.
